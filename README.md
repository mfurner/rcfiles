# rcfiles 

My configuration files for the applications I use on my #! install.

## Conky

### .conkyrc

-A centred time, date and weather widget in Open Sans Light
-Based on Conky-Vision by zagortenay [(found here)](http://custom-linux.deviantart.com/#/art/Conky-Vision-395777503?hf=1)

## Openbox

### rc.xml

-Pretty standard rc.xml for Openbox, but sets up media keys and changes some controls to be more comfortable. 
-Sets up a single desktop as I find more than 1 to be far too confusing.

## tint2

-Based on [this](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=1527#p1527) post by razienwolf on the #! forums
-A nice purple to match [Twily's Powerline Firefox CSS](https://userstyles.org/styles/102262/twily-s-powerline-firefox-css) for [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/).
-Open Sans Light
